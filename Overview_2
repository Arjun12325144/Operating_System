1.2.	Expected outcomes 

1.	Complete Framework Implementation: A fully functional library that can be integrated into applications requiring secure IPC.
2.	Comprehensive Security Features:
•	AES-256 encryption for data protection: AES-256 encryption refers to the Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key length. It's one of the most secure and widely used encryption algorithms in the world.
•	Certificate-based or token-based authentication: Both certificate-based and token-based authentication are widely used to secure access to applications, APIs, and systems.
•	
3.	Developer Resources:
•	Detailed API documentation: This documentation follows industry standards and provides clear guidance for developers integrating the library.
•	Security best practices: Ensuring secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is critical to preventing data leaks, unauthorized access, and system vulnerabilities.
•	Performance tuning recommendations: Optimizing the Secure IPC Framework ensures low-latency communication, high throughput, and minimal CPU/memory overhead.

4.	Testing and Validation:
•	Security audit results: A security audit ensures that the Secure IPC Framework follows best practices to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA).
•	Performance benchmarks: Performance testing evaluates latency, throughput, and resource utilization under different workloads to ensure the Secure IPC Framework is optimized for speed, scalability, and efficiency.
•	Compliance verification with relevant standards: This assessment aligns with global security standards for data protection, encryption, authentication, and secure communication.
