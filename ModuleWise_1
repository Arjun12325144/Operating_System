2.1.	Module 1: Core Communication Layer
Purpose: The Core Communication Layer is the foundation of a secure and efficient Inter-Process Communication (IPC) framework,
enabling reliable data exchange between processes. It serves as the base infrastructure upon which higher-layer security, authentication, and monitoring mechanisms are built.
Role: Establish reliable communication channels between processes, manage connections, and provide the low-level transport mechanisms.


2.2.	Module 2: Security Services Layer
Purpose: The Security Services Layer is responsible for ensuring secure communication between processes by
implementing encryption, authentication, access control, and integrity verification. It protects against
unauthorized access, data breaches, and tampering, ensuring that only legitimate processes can communicate securely.
Role: The Security Services Layer plays a critical role in protecting inter-process
communication (IPC) by enforcing encryption, authentication, access control, and integrity verification. It acts as a gatekeeper that ensures only authorized
processes can communicate securely, preventing unauthorized access, data leaks, and cyber threats.

2.3.	Module 3: API and Integration Layer
Purpose: The API and Integration Layer serves as the interface between applications and the
underlying IPC framework. It provides well-defined, easy-to-use functions that allow developers
to interact with the Core Communication Layer and Security Services Layer without handling low-level
complexities. This layer ensures seamless integration of the secure IPC framework into various applications,
making it easier to build scalable, secure, and efficient communication solutions.
Role: The API and Integration Layer acts as the bridge between the IPC framework and
application developers. It provides a simple, structured, and secure way for applications
to interact with the underlying communication and security mechanisms, without requiring developers to deal with low-level complexities.
